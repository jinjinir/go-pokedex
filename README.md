# Go-Pokedex

`Go-Pokedex` is a walkthrough project that I built using `Go` as the language.
I used the walkthrough in this
[Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo),
but I have built on top of it some functionalities such as the ability to clear
the screen, and checking if you have caught any pokemon before the Go-Pokedex
displays its entries.

This is mainly an exercise project for learning `Go`, and learning how to
interact with web APIs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jinjinir/go-pokedex.git
```

## Usage

1. `cd` into the project.

```bash
cd go-pokedex
```

2. Build the project and run the executable.

```bash

```

3. Interact with the REPL by typing in commands. A `help` function is provided.
